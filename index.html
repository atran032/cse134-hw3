      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Anthony</strong>, a computer science undergraduate at UCSD. I'm currently developing this portfolio page as an exercise in <i>semantic</i> HTML. I have many skills and interests, which you can discover throughout this website. Feel free to contact me with any queries!</p>

      <p>My love of computers developed early, when I first got my hands on the family computer. Ever since, it took off, and I was learning rudimentary programming since the 3rd grade. I love to learn the subject <i>and</i> I love to teach it too. My fondness of computers is also related to my love of <em>video games</em>, but I dabble in many non-digital interests as well. I love to <em>hike</em>, I <em>bake</em>, I practice <em>fencing</em>, and I love to study <em>history</em>.</p>

      <p>My guess as to why it was rarely used for so long is because it was only concurrently available on all major browsers only recently. Before then, some but not all browsers supported it. There's also the case that new browsers show up that must be accounted for. As for why it's unused, it's undesireable if it only displays correctly on some browsers but not others. The inconsistency is bad for accessability.</p>
